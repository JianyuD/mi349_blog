            <h1>
                The Back of language
            </h1>
            <p>
                In literature, language is a mirror, which not only shows the appearance of character but also implies symbolic meaning of some characters and stories.<br>
                Charlie Chan, made by Earl Derr Biggers, is a protagonist of the novel, Keepers of the Keys, and occupies the traditional Chinese role within western centralism.<br>
                Behind the Keepers’s language, a series of racist issues are reflected by the “mirror”.<br>
                Charlie Chan is more wisely, liberal and less masculine, in comparison to Fu-Manchu, one representative of yellow peril in the western world.<br>
                However, the  “acceptable” appearance of Charlie Chan is a product of yellow peril as well.<br>

                Firstly, it is obvious for readers to find out that chanspeak is a concrete form of filling with racism. For instance, “No knife in neighborhood of crime”,<br>
                “Tongue often hang man quicker than rope” and ”Truth, like football--receive many kicks before reaching goal” These statements  lack some necessary grammatical elements,<br>
                especially articles that must be used before English nouns.  This “incorrect speech” satisfies the stereotype of oriental culture in white people's imagination and has the effect of humor.<br>
                Due to the prevailing concept of white supremacy,
                it is difficult for westerners to accept a man with yellow skin. Only if a man with yellow skin does not bring trouble and danger to westerners and is tamed,<br>
                will westerners accept him in a limited way even if  he is a lawman who stands for justice.<br>
                Nonstandard English spoken from a lawman became a sign of allegiance to western people and a symbol that had been assimilated by American culture.<br>

                Moreover, as an oriental, Charlie Chan is not like any Asian around me. His disposition was shaped by the author in order to cater to the society which was deformed at that time. From many places in the novel,<br>
                Charlie Chan’s behavior has no difference with a gentle women instead of being depicted as a strong man . In the Keepers, when Charlie Chan first appeared on the train,<br>
                the author described Charlie Chan as “plump and middle-aged” and used some words which represent Asian in the impression of westerners, such as “little black eyes”.<br>
                Both in character and in appearance, Charlie Chan is a role piled up from stereotypes, stemming from racism. At that time, there were only two kinds of ways of treating Asians.<br>
                One was hatred and fear, such as Fu Manzhou, and the other was conditional love, such as the assimilated Charlie Chan.<br>

                Through ”mirror”, readers can see a Chinese, Charlie Chan, who was domesticated and transformed by white people .<br>
                Charlie Chan was always a second class person who was different from the western world based on the concept of western culture itself.<br>

                This is my first essay in the IAH course. The main character of the essay is Charlie Chen.<br>
                The purpose of this article is to analyze Charlie Chen’s language characteristics and what can be seen from behind the language characteristics.<br>

        <h2>
            The relationship between outlaws and lawman
        </h2>
        <article>
            <p>
                Friedrich Engels once discussed why do humans commit a sin in his book, The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State. Simplifying speaking, the inner darkness is the seed.<br>
                The environment is soil. Event is nourishment. After a crime occurs, there will be two kinds of people, outlaws and lawman. Timely Rain Song Jiang ever said,<br>
                No one is born an outlaw and no one is always an outlaw,<br>
                but from the perspective of modern society, no one is born a lawman and no one is always a lawman.<br>

                No one wants to commit crimes. From the perspective of Engels, there are two points from society, which are environment and event. The environment and events will accelerate people's inner darkness,<br>
                forcing people to commit crimes in a deformed society. No one wants to be a lawman.<br>
                But in a deformed society there are always people who have different “seed” in their mind. Franz Ritter von Liszt,<br>
                a professor of German criminal law, believes that the best social policy is the best criminal policy.<br>
                The appearance of lawman represents the renewal of social system and social policy as well, such as the appearance of Martin Luther King.<br>

                No one is always an outlaw meanwhile no one is always a lawman. Fyodor Dostoevsky, a famous Russian author, claim that crime is a product of social protest and environment in his book,<br>
                Crime and Punishment. No one will become a criminal again if he lives in a stable society but also there will be no concept corresponding to it, lawman.<br>

                From the perspective of the theory of relativity, criminals representing evil and police representing justice will appear in any country in any era.<br>
                They are like two ends of the balance. If there are more gangsters, there will be more police. If there are more police , Will there be fewer gangsters?<br>
                Probably not. From a historical point of view, the reason for the increase in police may be the dictatorship of the rulers.<br>
                Society will always develop in a relatively balanced mode, and I hope that peace will be always accompanied us<br>
